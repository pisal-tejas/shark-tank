### Problem Description :
Core Idea:
My project delves into Indian entrepreneurship and investment through "Shark Tank India," providing a much-needed in-depth analysis of the subject.

Problem & Solution:
I want to offer insights into investment trends, how well pitches work, and the types of businesses on "Shark Tank India." I'm using Power BI, a tool for showing data visually, to create easy-to-use dashboards. These dashboards will simplify the data, showing things like where investments go, which pitches succeed, what sharks invest in, valuations, and whether startups have revenue or not.

Addressing the Need:
Picture this: a land of entrepreneurial dreams, but a lack of roadmaps. That's where our project shines. We're bridging the gap in understanding startup investments and pitches in India, as seen on "Shark Tank India."

The Problem We're Fixing:
Imagine watching a thrilling show but missing the backstory. That's the challenge we're tackling. We're delving into "Shark Tank India" to reveal the secrets – who's investing in what and why, what makes pitches sizzle, and which sectors are a magnet for investors.


Our Solution, Simplified:
1. Power BI: I use Microsoft Power BI for data visualization, transforming 'Shark Tank India' data into engaging dashboards, showcasing investment trends, pitch success, shark portfolios, valuations, and pre-revenue startups. Power BI simplifies complex data.
2. Azure DevOps Deployment: Insights are deployed on Azure DevOps for easy access, prioritizing user-friendliness.
3. Microsoft Excel : I've sourced data from  Excel files to ensure comprehensive analysis.
